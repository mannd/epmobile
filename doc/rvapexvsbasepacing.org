* Use
- Determine if retrograde conduction is via a septal accessory pathway (AP) or the AV node (AVN).
- Useful when SVT is not inducible or post-ablation to exclude continued retrograde AP conduction.
* Technique
- Using a deflectable catheter, position at apex and then at posterior base of RV in 30° RAO view.
- Ventricular pacing at each site at same pacing cycle length.
- Measure stimulus to atrium (S-A) at each site.
* Results
- S-A is shorter pacing at base compared with apex in patients with AP conduction only.
- S-A is longer pacing at base compared with apex in patients with retrograde AVN conduction only.
- Note that patients with combined retrograde AP and AV nodal conduction were excluded from the study population.  However change in atrial activation sequence when pacing at the 2 sites suggests combined retrograde AP and AVN conduction.
- Note that only patients with posteroseptal APs were included in the study, though the technique is probably also applicable to patients with anteroseptal or para-Hisian APs, as long as basal pacing site is close to the AP.
